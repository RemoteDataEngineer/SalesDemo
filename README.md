<h1> <b> Purpose </b> </h1>
Showcase Power Bi mastery including DAX functions for Month to Date calculations, DAX tables for top 3 values, visuals with drill down and slicing functionality, bookmarks for navigation, a glossary and accompanying documentation.  

I typically avoid as many DAX tables as possible by performing all transformations in a pipeline / SSIS package / miscellaneous data transformation on the server side, but I wanted to include one Power Bi in my portfolio that uses Import instead of Direct Query so that it would load faster.

<h1> <b> Data Architecture </b> </h1>

Instead of using real data, I created sample spreadsheets for Import.

<h1> <b> </b>Power Bi </b> </h1>

This Power Bi uses Imported Data so that it is rendered quicker and cannot be refreshed.

<h2> Power Bi - Tabs </h2>

<li> Index - Pages listing Bookmarks to all pages. </li>
<li> Flash Report – Snapshot of Sales by Prsnl and Products for a selected period of time. Includes a leaderboard for Prsnl and Products sold. </li>
